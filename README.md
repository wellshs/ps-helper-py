Simple helper for problem solving written in Python

While studying problem solving. We need to test out code.

For problem solving, we need to test 3 things.

 1. Identity between our code's output & expected output.
 2. Use less time than problem restriction.
 3. Use less memory than problem restriction.
 
This python project help you to check 3 things if input, output & restriction is given.
